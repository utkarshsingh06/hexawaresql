--TASK1 Database Design:


-- 1. Create the database named "SISDB"
create database SISDB

/*2. Define the schema for the Students, Courses, Enrollments, Teacher, and Payments tables based
on the provided schema. Write SQL scripts to create the mentioned tables with appropriate data
types, constraints, and relationships. */

first_name varchar(30) not null,
last_name varchar(30) not null,
date_of_birth date not null,
email varchar(35) unique not null,

)

-- create Teacher table
create table Teacher(

last_name varchar(25) not null,
email varchar(35) unique not null
)
